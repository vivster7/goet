- [ ] First goal -- get reverse debugging working with just repr strings. Things will not be inspectble.

- [ ] Convert the debugAdapter from TS to Python.

- [ ] Change repr strings to pickled objects

- [ ] I'm having trouble making serializing everything (like instances). 
      I think I'll have to use pickling to save these objects and then inspect them on demand. 
      This means the debug Adapter will have to be written in Python.
      
        >>> cattr.GenConverter().unstructure(a)
        <__main__.A object at 0x103d7b760>
