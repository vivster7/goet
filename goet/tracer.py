class Code:
    """Code objects represent byte-compiled executable Python code, or bytecode.

    The difference between a code object and a function object is that the function object contains an explicit reference to the
    functionâ€™s globals (the module in which it was defined), while a code object contains no context; also the default argument
    values are stored in the function object, not in the code object (because they represent values calculated at run-time).
    Unlike function objects, code objects are immutable and contain no references (directly or indirectly) to mutable objects.

    Special read-only attributes:
        co_name gives the function name
        co_argcount is the total number of positional arguments (including positional-only arguments and arguments with default values)
        co_posonlyargcount is the number of positional-only arguments (including arguments with default values)
        co_kwonlyargcount is the number of keyword-only arguments (including arguments with default values)
        co_nlocals is the number of local variables used by the function (including arguments)
        co_varnames is a tuple containing the names of the local variables (starting with the argument names)
        co_cellvars is a tuple containing the names of local variables that are referenced by nested functions
        co_freevars is a tuple containing the names of free variables
        co_code is a string representing the sequence of bytecode instructions
        co_consts is a tuple containing the literals used by the bytecode
        co_names is a tuple containing the names used by the bytecode
        co_filename is the filename from which the code was compiled
        co_firstlineno is the first line number of the function
        co_lnotab is a string encoding the mapping from bytecode offsets to line numbers (for details see the source code of the interpreter)
        co_stacksize is the required stack size
        co_flags is an integer encoding a number of flags for the interpreter.

    The following flag bits are defined for co_flags: bit 0x04 is set if the function uses the *arguments syntax to accept an arbitrary number of positional arguments
        bit 0x08 is set if the function uses the **keywords syntax to accept arbitrary keyword arguments
        bit 0x20 is set if the function is a generator.

    Future feature declarations (from __future__ import division) also use bits in co_flags to indicate whether a code object was compiled with a particular feature enabled: bit 0x2000 is set if the function was compiled with future division enabled
        bits 0x10 and 0x1000 were used in earlier versions of Python.

    Other bits in co_flags are reserved for internal use.

    If a code object represents a function, the first item in co_consts is the documentation string of the function, or None if undefined.

class Frame:
    """Frame objects represent execution frames. They may occur in traceback objects (see below), and are also passed to registered trace functions.

    Special read-only attributes:
        f_back is to the previous stack frame (towards the caller), or None if this is the bottom stack frame
        f_code is the code object being executed in this frame
        f_locals is the dictionary used to look up local variables
        f_globals is used for global variables
        f_builtins is used for built-in (intrinsic) names
        f_lasti gives the precise instruction (this is an index into the bytecode string of the code object).

    Special writable attributes:
        f_trace, if not None, is a function called for various events during code execution (this is used by the debugger).
        Normally an event is triggered for each new source line - this can be disabled by setting f_trace_lines to False.

    Implementations may allow per-opcode events to be requested by setting f_trace_opcodes to True.
    Note that this may lead to undefined interpreter behaviour if exceptions raised by the trace function escape to the function being traced.

    f_lineno is the current line number of the frame â€” writing to this from within a trace function jumps to the given line (only for the bottom-most frame).
    A debugger can implement a Jump command (aka Set Next Statement) by writing to f_lineno.
